## Motivation

How do daily habits change as academic workload increases? This project aims to examine personal physical health data to observe the impact of increasing academic intensity. By analyzing health metrics during three academic phases — **Preparatory School**, **Freshman Year**, and **Sophomore Year** — I hope to uncover patterns and correlations between academic schedules and physical health.

## Dataset

### **Source**  
- Data collected from Apple Health application in XML format.  

### **Description**  
- Metrics include **step count**, **flights climbed**, **energy burned**, and other physical health indicators.  
- Time-sensitive health data across multiple timelines.  
- Data spans three academic periods, enabling a comparative analysis of health metrics under varying academic intensities.

### **Time Periods**  
1. **Preparatory School Period**: Lower academic workload.  
2. **Freshman Year**: Moderate academic workload.  
3. **Sophomore Year**: High academic workload.

## Project Goals

1. **Analyze** how academic intensity affects physical activity and energy expenditure.  
2. **Identify trends** and correlations across different academic phases.  
3. **Provide insights** into the relationship between academic workload and physical well-being.

## Methods and Techniques

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Parse XML data from Apple Health.  
- Clean and structure the dataset for analysis.  
- Handle missing or irrelevant data.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Use visualizations such as:
  - **Boxplots** to show distribution and variability in physical health metrics.  
  - **Scatter plots** to observe correlations between metrics like step count and energy burned.  
  - **Histograms** to analyze frequency distributions of activities.  
  - **Line charts** to observe trends over time.  
- Calculate summary statistics to detect patterns.  

### **3. Time-Series Analysis**
- Analyze data over time to observe long-term changes.  
- Identify seasonal patterns and anomalies in physical health metrics.  

### **4. Comparative Analysis**
- Compare physical activity and energy expenditure across different academic periods.  

### **5. Machine Learning (Optional)**
- Use regression analysis to predict health trends.  
- Apply clustering to group similar patterns in physical health metrics.

## Future Work

2. **[FutureGuess Notebook](https://github.com/cagatayeroglu/AppleHealth/blob/main/FutureGuess.ipynb)**  


1. **Expand Dataset**  
   - Include additional metrics like sleep patterns, stress levels, and mood for a holistic analysis.  

2. **Collaborative Analysis**  
   - Compare findings with similar data from peers to identify common trends and outliers.  

3. **Automation**  
   - Develop automated tools for real-time health tracking and analysis.  

4. **Broader Scope**  
   - Extend the project to analyze the impact of other external factors, such as exam periods or seasonal changes.
